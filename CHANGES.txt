Changes from 0.2.2:

  * API changes in model.Query to support relevance scores (#1175):
      - Changed getArtists() to return a list of ArtistResult objects.
      - Changed getReleases() to return a list of ReleaseResult objects.
      - Changed getTracks() to return a list of TrackResult objects.

  * API changes in model.ReleaseEvent:
      - Renamed getCountryId() to getCountry()
      - Renamed __init__()'s 'countryId' parameter to 'country'.

  * API changes in model.Artist:
      - Renamed setType()'s 'typeUri' parameter to 'type_'.

  * API changes in model.ArtistAlias:
      - Renamed __init__()'s and setType()'s 'typeUri' parameter to 'type_'.

  * API changes to wsxml.Metadata:
      - Removed getArtistList(), getReleaseList(), getTrackList()
      - Added getArtistResults(), getReleaseResults(), and getTrackResults(),
	returning ArtistResult, ReleaseResult, and TrackResult objects,
	respectively.

  * General API changes:
      - Classes are now derived from 'object' (new-style classes).
      - Marked all supposedly private attributes as private ('attr' -> '_attr').
      - Marked the DOM utility functions in wsxml.py as private.

  * All getter and setter methods are now exposed as properties, too.

  * Added the class wsxml.MbXmlWriter which generates MMD XML.

  * Fixed model.Release.TYPE_EP ('Ep' -> 'EP').

  * Added TYPE_PERSON and TYPE_GROUP constans to model.Artist.

  * Modules now have __all__, which makes 'import *' possible (but don't do it).

  * The country code in model.ReleaseEvent is now optional. This is due to
    the server which doesn't provide country codes for release collection
    queries (and just the earliest date).

  * Added more example code and improved the documentation.

Changes from 0.1.0:

  * API change: Switched from TRM to PUID (Luks)
    All interfaces with 'Trm' or 'trm' in the name are affected.
  * python 2.3 compatibility fixes (#1160)
