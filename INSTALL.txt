Installation Instructions
-------------------------

First of all, install the following dependencies:
  
  1. python (tested with 2.4)
     Standard python 2.3 or later should work.
     
     -> http://www.python.org/

  2. libmusicbrainz (tested with 2.1.1)
     Any version above 2.0 should do, so the packages shipped with most
     linux distributions should work. Required for DiscID calculation.

     -> http://musicbrainz.org/products/client/download.html

  3. ctypes (tested with 0.9.6 and 0.9.9.3)
     Version 0.9.0 or later should work, which is included in recent
     linux distributions. This is required for DiscID calculation.

     -> http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/


Installation works using python's standard distutils (on most systems,
root permissions are required):

    python setup.py install


Optionally, API documentation can be generated using epydoc. This command
runs epydoc (http://epydoc.sf.net) which creates a 'html' directory containing
the documentation:

    python setup.py docs
